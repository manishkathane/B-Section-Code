            The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Since then, there have been many different versions of HTML. The most widely used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, which became an official standard in December 1999.
            </p>HTML uses a system of markup tags to specify various elements and their relationships within a web page. In HTML, these tags come in pairs. They are enclosed in angle brackets and typically include the opening and closing tags. In HTML we have some information such as text, images, and links, and with the help of all this information,
             we can make up the <br>actual content for the website.
